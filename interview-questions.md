# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: You use the method super() to inherit the properties from the parent class 

  Researched answer: it referes back to the parent constructor and because javascript enforces it to use the 'this' in a constructor



2. What is a virtual DOM?

  Your answer: The Document object model it is like another layer that react can use to change things on the page in real time

  Researched answer: in react it uses the VDOM to manipulate data by us telling react what state of the user interface to be in 



3. When creating a basic (stateless) class component in React, what are the necessary elements needed to display "Hello World" in the browser?

  Your answer: It needs a render(){} and return () if theres more then one tag to return then the react fragments are needed <></>

  Researched answer: stateless elements are also called presentational components or dumb components and they just  need the render to return jsx to the view



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a way of writing html inside of a javascript file

  Researched answer: JSX makes it so we sont have to use separate technologies which is helpful to see when we can see the UI in the JS code



5. What is state in React?

  Your answer: State in react is like a container that holds data that we can manipulate 

  Researched answer: state is fully controlled my the component itself



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:  Hoisting is the process of bringing functions to the top of a js file because js is a top down language and if a function is involked before it is declared then it will throw an error 

  Researched answer: not just functions but variables also,  and variables defined with 'let' and 'const' are hoisted but they can not be used until after they are declared



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods - mounting updating and unmounting
- React props - like html attributes and js arguments 
- event.preventDefault() - prevents the default action of a DOM event like a page refresh
- DOM events - stuff that happens on the page like a keystroke or a scroll 
- MVC - model, view, controller
